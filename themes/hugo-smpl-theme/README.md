# Hugo SMPL Theme

Hugo SMPL Theme is based on the [SMPL template by BlackTie](http://blacktie.co/2013/12/smpl-a-simple-contact-page/). It was ported to Hugo for training and fun. It is rather configurable and flexible despite its simplicity.

## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ mkdir themes
    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-smpl-theme

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.


## Getting started

After installing the SMPL Theme successfully it requires a just a few more steps to get your site running.


### The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](//github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-smpl-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](//github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-smpl-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml). To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](//github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-smpl-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change the strings in this theme. Play with already placed logo, social icons, and background image or use yours.


### Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server. 

    $ hugo server -w

Now enter `localhost:1313` in the address bar of your browser.
